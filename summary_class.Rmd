# Novel landscapes

This is a revision class aiming to summarize what is a novel landscape, what is a novel landscape, how human activities create this modified landscapes, what are the mais effects on biodiversity and what are the key actions needed to restore and manage human-modified landscapes

## Class outline

1) Novel ecosystems, anthromes and human-modified landscapes

2) Habitat fragmentation

3) Biotic homogenization

4) Socioecological productive systems

## Novel Ecosystems

Ecology has been historically focused on what explains sepecies assembly (ocurrence and abundance) in the remanants of natural habitats as if they were discrete categories or entities. The concept of novel ecosystem emerged to cope with the duality between 'natural and non-natural' or between 'pristine vs. degraded'. Excepting for the large tracts of natural terretrial systems such as the boreal forests of the tropical ones, almost all ecosystems of the Earth are embedded into a 'human matrix'. New species come while others, more sensitive can go or become locally extinct. The expected consequences varies from small changes in species abudannce or composition to large disruptions in ecosytem functions.

The idea that the earth systems experience varying degrees of human influence is a central issue in modern ecology, princiaplly when it comes to assess the future of biodiversity in our planet. While the term novel ecosystems brings a definition of this emerging landscapes, the notion of human-modified landscapes tries to assess how modified can be a landscapem mostly using concepts and tools of the landscape ecology. Actually, ecologists know to assess the landscape structure and quantify aspects of both composition and configuration of huma-modified landscapes. 

More recently, the notion of Anthromes came to redraft our view of human dominated landscapes.
