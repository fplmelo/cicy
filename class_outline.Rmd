## On the novelty of landscapes

Ecology traditionally focuses on what explains species assembly (occurrence and abundance) in the remnants of natural habitats as if they were discrete categories or entities. The concept of novel ecosystems emerged to cope with the duality between 'natural and non-natural' or between 'pristine vs. degraded'. Except for the large tracts of natural terrestrial systems such as the boreal forests of the tropical ones, almost all ecosystems of the Earth are embedded into a 'human matrix'. New species come while others, more sensitive can go or become locally extinct. The expected consequences vary from small changes in species abundance or composition to large disruptions in ecosystem functions.

The idea that the earth systems experience varying degrees of human influence is a central issue in modern ecology, principally when it comes to assessing the future of biodiversity in our planet. While the term novel ecosystems brings a definition of these emerging landscapes, the notion of human-modified landscapes tries to assess how modified can be a landscape mostly using concepts and tools of the landscape ecology. Actually, ecologists know to assess the landscape structure and quantify aspects of both composition and configuration of human-modified landscapes. 

More recently, the notion of Anthromes came to redraft our view of human dominated landscapes. This notion helps to estimate the amount of earth surface used by humans and classify types of land use as well as place them in time, reconstructing a sort of sequence that initiates with extraction of natural resources and ends up with urban ecosystems. Understanding land use dynamics, its drivers and its effects on biodiversity is crucial to plan and execute management strategies to minimize species loss while increasing benefits to diverse human societies. 


## Habitat fragmentation  

Among the many consequences of land use changes, one of the most studied and pervasive is the 'habitat fragmentation'. There is an ongoing debate on whether habitat fragmentation is good or bad to biodiversity. Solving this dilemma is beyond the scope of this class but I recommend (for those more interested) reading the main arguments of both sides. This is an exciting scientific dispute where solid arguments can be found on both sides. Most of us can identify 'patches' of natural habitats when traveling around. The fact that species now live in patched habitats is both an ecological and evolutionary novelty for most of them. All kinds of ecological effects have been reported for these patched communities. Shrinking populations, disruption in ecological interactions, changes in alfa, beta and gamma diversity (in taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic dimensions) and biological invasion are among the most outstanding ones.  

Therefore, it is important to understand how species survive (or not) in these complex landscapes formed by natural habitats under varying degrees of human impact. What species thrive? Who are those gone? What are the short -to long term effects for ecosystem functioning?

## Social-ecological systems

Because we are dealing with landscapes altered by human activities, it is a contradiction that classical ecological approaches have been paying attention mostly to the biological and physical aspects of the landscapes. The human dimension has been historically neglected due to both conceptual and analytical limitations. Actually, we can count with a well developed and novel approach to landscapes that sees both the natural and human environments as a coupled system, the social-ecological systems (SES). Rather than replacing landscape ecology with the SES approach, the latter must be summed up to the previous in an integrated framework to assess the impacts of human activities on landscapes.


## Landscape management - habitat restoration

Considering that most of the Earth's surface is under varying levels of human impact, management becomes essential if not urgent. Management must be seen as a toolbox filled with diverse and adaptive strategies guided by sound scientific evidence and the most up to date knowledge. Within this toolbox an important issue stands up, forest restoration. If we are to create biodiversity-friendly landscapes, ecological restoration is surely needed. Actually, restoration is a hot-topic in ecology, conservation and politics. Numerous global initiatives have been launched to push restoration programs around the world. We have now accumulated enough knowledge to: map, prioritize, design, execute and monitor restoration initiatives. All these phases are based on solid ecological information that was presented during this course. However, there are challenges ahead for increasing the reach and scale of restoration programs and these have to do with who benefits from restoration and how these benefits are shared. Landscapes management through restoration is an ambitious goal whose success is tightly linked to social and environmental justice. Landscape management must not reproduce current social inequalities and must be used as a transformation tool for a sustainable future. 

## Exercise: Planetary boundaries

1) Read the text on [Mongabay.com](https://news.mongabay.com/2021/03/the-nine-boundaries-humanity-must-respect-to-keep-the-planet-habitable/) and watch the short movie bellow

2) Write an essay 800-1000 words trying to connect what you have learned along this module with the **planetary boundaries** framework
