## **Research overview**

The broad question that guides my research program is: **How biodiversity and human livelihoods are intertwined in human-modified landscapes?** To answer this question, I draw on both the theoretical and analytical tools of natural sciences and on the social-ecological systems (SES) framework. I am interested in all kinds of interactions between biodiversity (especially plants) and human activities that take place in working landscapes such as rangelands, farmlands, peri-urban and fragmented landscapes. 

Along my career I have been assessing biodiversity conservation problems through many lenses such as: The role of human-modified landscapes in maintaining biodiversity [(Melo et al 2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169534713000037); How proliferation of disturbance-adapted species cause biotic homogenization [(Filgueiras et al 2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169534721000562); How to scale-up long lasting restoration projects [(Melo et al 2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1462901113001494) and assessing alternative successional pathways in Tropical forests [(Arroyo-Rodríguez et al. 2017)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/brv.12231). Recently, I introduced the novel concept of “forest security” as a fourth dimension for the water, energy and food security nexus [(Melo et al 2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-00608-z). Briefly, my research interest is to address how human-made landscapes can (or not) maintain both biodiversity and human livelihoods. 

My plans for the next years at the Copernicus Institute is to build a dedicated research group on **sustainable management of social-ecological landscapes**, working on the interface between ecological and social sciences. This is the result of the maturity and development of my critical thinking on the drivers of biodiversity rearrangements in human-dominated ecosystems. Landscapes are not naturally given, but constructed, even the “wildest” ones. Therefore, I believe that an integrated approach to biodiversity conservation demands the assessment of both human and non-human components of a landscape. 

In the short to medium term, this research program aims to address the following questions: 

1. What drives the resilience of both human and plant communities in working landscapes in seasonally dry tropical forests?
2. How are biodiversity and ecosystem functions related in dry tropical ecosystems?
3. What is the contribution of nature to human livelihoods in Neotropical dry forests? 

The long-term goal is to create a synthesis working group aiming to quantify nature's contributions to people across tropical dry forests while assessing how human activities modify both taxonomic and functional diversity of tropical social-ecological landscapes. I draw on both conceptual and analytical tools from landscape ecology, functional ecology and social-ecological systems frameworks.

## **Current research projects**

I can bring to Copernicus Institute two established projects with associated grants. 

### **Assessing the role of forests for water, energy and food secutiries**

This project aims to understand human dependencies on forest services through the quantification of the concept of “forest security” that adds a new dimension to the water, energy and food security nexus (WEF-Nexus). I am the principal investigator (PI) of this project and received a grant from the Brazilian Science Council (CNPq). I lead a diverse team formed by a research team of academic staff and graduate students from three countries (USA, UK and Brazil). This grant is in the final phase and there is only an academic visit scheduled to happen during 2022 to meet Dr. Luke Parry from Lancaster University, UK.

### **cDEEP - Caatina Dry Ecosystem Ecological Program**

The second research project aims to assess the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function (BEF). Changes in alpha and beta diversity (considering both the taxonomic and functional dimensions) must affect how human-impacted ecosystems function and this can be assessed through many types of stressors such as: fire, nutrient availability and biological invasion. This research program is part of a global network of experiments on dry forests [(NutNet-DAGnet)](https://nutnet.org/dragnet) and a drone-view of the site can be seen in this [video](https://youtu.be/C21RHdxeu3E). In this long-term ecological experiment conducted in collaboration among Brazilian colleagues we want to assess how stressors linked to typical land use of the Brazilian dry forest such as goats pastoralism, slash-and-burn agriculture and biological invasion affect the assembly patterns and processes of biological communities of plants and insects.

I count with a broad and productive network of well established scientific collaborations with researchers from institutions in the UK (e.g. co-supervising PhD students, project co-management and previous sabbatical visit to Lancaster University with Dr. Luke Parry), USA (e.g. CO-I on PARTNERS project with Dr. Robin Chazdon at University of Connecticut), Mexico (e.g. co-running postgraduate field courses in Mexico and Brazil with Dr. Víctor Arroyo-Rodríguez, UNAM). 

## **Why Copernicus Institute? **

Many of my colleagues credit me as having a sharp critical thinking that takes me beyond my comfort zone when doing science. Early in my career I experienced writing reviews and perspective papers where I could share somo of my reflections on the ecology and management of altered forest ecosystems. My innovative ideas on social-ecological systems are expressed on pieces that discuss: The role of human-modified landscapes in maintaining biodiversity [(Melo et al 2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534713000037); How proliferation of disturbance-adapted species cause biotic homogenization [(Tabarelli et al 2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320712002893?via%3Dihub); How to scale-up long lasting restoration projects [(Melo et al 2013b)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901113001494); Assessing alternative successional pathways in Tropical forests [(Arroyo-Rodríguez et al. 2017)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/brv.12231) and recently, introducing the novel concept of “forest security” as a fourth dimension for the water, energy and food security nexus [(Melo et al 2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-00608-z). I have also contributed to many other cutting edge ideas and scientific debates on themes related to landscape ecology such as the debate around whether forest fragmentation is [good](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2018.12.026) or [bad](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2018.07.022) to biodiversity. I consider that I am able to constantly think on new and integrative ideas that address how human-made landscapes can (or cannot) maintain both biodiversity and human livelihoods. I have a strong publication record in leading journals with a broad network of collaborators from many countries.

My contributions to society goes beyond the academic world. In Brazil, where I am based, I am part of the [scientific committee of the Brazilian Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services](https://www.bpbes.net.br/quem-somos/biografias/) (the Brazilian chapter of the IPBES). Recently I was selected as **lead author** for the  and I am part of the public policy workgroup of the Brazilian Association of Ecologists (ABECO). I am currently leading a research team working simultaneously on two multi-institutional projects funded by the Brazilian National Council for Research Development (CNPq). I have co-organized three symposiums in international meetings (SER 2011; ATBC 2013 and 2017). [In 2014 I first-authored a paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/btp.12114) that called for the action to conserve the three-banded armadillo and its habitat, the Brazilian dry forest, after this animal was chosen as the official mascot of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. This resulted in a [huge campaign](https://www.change.org/p/brazilian-minister-of-the-environment-izabella-teixeira-for-the-brazilian-government-to-create-a-natural-reserve-for-the-armadillo/dashboard?source_location=user_profile_started) and [media coverage](https://www.theguardian.com/science/animal-magic/2014/jun/09/fifa-brazil-failing-threatened-armadillo-conservation#:~:text=In%202012%2C%20Fifa%20unveiled%20its,a%20colourful%20armadillo%20called%20Fuleco.) that ended up with the creation of a 110,000 hectares protected area after my personal participation in political negotiation and the elaboration of supporting studies for the creation of this protected area. This story of success in conservation is taught in a [second paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/btp.12681) and in a [videO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQHAgyrXims). 


## **Research vision, future plans and networking **

My plan at the Copernicus Institute, for the next three years, is to build a dedicated research group on sustainable management of social-ecological tropical landscapes. Joining the C staff of researchers is a singular opportunity to establish productive scientific partnerships with its highly regarded team of scientists The Copernicus Institute expertises cover several of my research interests under all main research areas of: Global Change, Biodiversity, Earth Observation and Ecosystem Functioning. Furthermore, I see my research program contributing to many of the six cross-cutting topics such as Forests, Ecosystem Services, Sustainability and Citizen Science, for example. 

I can contribute readily to the Copernicus Institute portfolio of research grants as I am now coordinating two simultaneous projects (until December 2023) funded by the Brazilian Council for Research Development (CNPq) that fits many research expertise of the Copernicus Institute and attend to the desired expertise of candidates for this job advertisement. In a few words, these projects aim to understand the role of climate change, biological invasion and natural resource uses on plant communities, human livelihoods and ecosystem service provision of the Brazilian seasonal tropical dry forests. Additionally, I plan to apply for EU grants such as the ones from [ERC](https://erc.europa.eu/) (e.g. Consolidator Grants) and/or diverse international funds from private institutions and NGOs. 

I follow the research outputs of some Copernicus Institute researchers such as Dr. Francisco Lloret Maya and Professor Maurizio Mencuccini and their work on the functional ecology of drought resistance. Impossible not to be excited with the possibility meet in person and, if possible, work with Professor Josep Penuelas, one of the world’s most important ecology scientists. Also, Dr. Joan Pino Vilalta, current Copernicus Institute director, runs an interesting research program on landscape ecology, one of my fields of expertise. Many other researchers from other UAB departments such as the ICREA are references for my current and future work.

My actual links with Brazilian and Mexican institutions allow me to expand Copernicus Institute research scope and influence to Latin America with access to funds from these countries in cooperation with a network of collaborators. I have developed a broad and productive network with researchers from institutions in the UK (e.g. co-supervising PhD students, project co-management and previous sabbatical visit to Lancaster University with Dr. Luke Parry), USA (e.g. CO-I on PARTNERS project with Dr. Robin Chazdon at University of Connecticut) and Mexico (e.g. co-running postgraduate field courses in Mexico and Brazil with Dr. Victor Arroyo-Rodríguez, UNAM). This is reflected in my publishing record in journals including Nature Sustainability, PNAS, Trends in Ecology and Evolution, Biological Reviews and Ecology Letters. 

Finally, I believe that moving to Copernicus Institute represents a great opportunity to expand and redraft my career. My personal research mission is to contribute to construct effective bridges between ecology and society and this fits nicely with Copernicus Institute's mission and vision. I look forward to have a chance to establish an innovative and productive research program in the vibrant environment of the **Copernicus Institute**.
