# **Selection Process for the University of Portsmouth**

This webpage is meant to provide all information to the selection committee regarding my teaching and research abilities as a candidate to the job of **Senior Lecturer in Terrestrial Ecology** at the School of Biological Sciences.

Here I present a brief simulation on how I use to organize classes using online tools that combine:

1) slide presentation 

2) short texts 

3) multimedia (links, videos, photos)

4) exercise

## How to navigate this site

1. The *15 min class* link I offer a brief summary that should be used as a guide for the recorded class specifically prepared following the instruction given in the email recieved on Monday 28th June 2021: 
**"Explain the cause and effects of selected human impacts on the natural world and explore possible solutions for key environmental issues"**. The search committee will find summary texts to the topics of the class, references, slide presentation and the link for the recorded classrom in this section

2. In the section **Research Overview** evaluators will find the link to the presentatiion on my research overview and a brief description on my past, present and future research plans
